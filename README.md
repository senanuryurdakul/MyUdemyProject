 ASP.NET Core Web API – Udemy Course Progress (by Murat Yücedağ)

This repository contains my personal progress and hands-on practice based on the **"ASP.NET Core Web API – Rapid API & API Consume"** course by **Murat Yücedağ** on Udemy.

I created this project to solidify my understanding of API development with ASP.NET Core, and to document my learning journey through the course.

 What I Have Done So Far 

-  Created a clean ASP.NET Core Web API project using Visual Studio  
-  Set up the project structure following best practices  
-  Learned and applied routing with controllers  
-  Defined and used models and data transfer objects (DTOs)  
-  Implemented basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations  
-  Learned how to use HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) in Web API  
-  Tructured controller actions and responses properly  
-  Practiced with static data to simulate in-memory operations  
-  Worked with Postman to test API endpoints

Upcoming: Adding database support, dependency injection, service layers, and consuming external APIs (as the course continues).


- ASP.NET Core 6 / 7
- Visual Studio 2022
- C#
- RESTful API design
- Swagger (for API documentation)
- Postman

Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a personal documentation and progress tracker for my Web API learning process.  
The code is written by me while following the lessons, and reflects my understanding of the concepts taught.


 What’s Next?

- Adding database connection with EF Core  
- Creating service and repository layers  
- Using RapidAPI to consume external APIs  
- Token-based authentication and security layers  
- Building a client to consume the API
